# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an interactive movie recommendation system that combines sentiment analysis, rating prediction, and user preferences to provide personalized movie suggestions. The system will leverage datasets from IMDb and MovieLens, applying machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze movie reviews to categorize them as positive or negative.
- **Rating Prediction**: Predict movie ratings based on user reviews and metadata.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generate movie recommendations based on user preferences, sentiments, and ratings.

## Datasets
1. **[IMDb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashirwadsangwan/imdb-dataset)**: Contains movies, reviews, ratings and more.
2. **[Sentimental Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)**: A collection of movie reviews from IMDb with binary sentiment classification.
3. **[MovieLens Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sherinclaudia/movielens)**: User ratings for movies, along with demographic information.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data processing and machine learning models.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models), NLTK (for NLP).
- **Frontend**: React.js for developing the interactive web interface.
- **Backend**: Python Flask or FastAPI for server-side operations.
- **Database**: SQL or NoSQL database for storing processed data and user interactions.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly for data visualization.
